# GCEI (Grab it, Check it, Extract it, Install it)
WIP Package manager (not licensed yet)
This package manager is a DEMO therefore it will not install ant programs (yet).
I initally made this package manager to save time installing packages on Gentoo
Linux via Portage because Gentoo is one of the only linux distros compatible with PowerPC
but now I also want this to be the default package manager for my upcoming Linux distro.
If you want to help me out with this contact me at incogninto123(at)gmail(dot)com.
